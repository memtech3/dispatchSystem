# dispatchSystem

An attempt at developing an open source computer aided dispatch system, currently just for funsies. I'd love to build something that could actually be useful but I recognize that I have limited time and experience so we'll see where this goes...

# Tech
- Vue3
- Tailwind CSS with many snippets from the Flowbite documentation
- Storybook
- Supabase (for backend, may change when I start backend work, I'll start backend work after I get a good 'nuff UI together)
